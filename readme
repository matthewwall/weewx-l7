This is a WeeWX driver for the Raddy L7 LoRa weather station.


===============================================================================
Installation

1) install the driver

Testing

You can test the driver by invoking it directly on the command line.  Specify
the IP address of the station.  You should see WeeWX loop packets with the
current sensor data from the station.

python3 l7.py --addr 192.168.x.y

You might have to set the PYTHONPATH to find the WeeWX code.  For example, if
WeeWX was installed using apt or yum, the WeeWX code is in /usr/share/weewx:

PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx python3 l7.py --help
